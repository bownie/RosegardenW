/**
 * ListEditView is a subclass of EditViewBase that contains some
 * functionality used by "old-style" EditView implementations but not
 * required by the new QGraphicsView-based notation and matrix views.
 *
 * The main thing this code implements is a refresh-on-repaint
 * mechanism through paintEvent.  This mechanism is much too complex
 * to be really justified for the only classes that use it now -- it
 * was original designed for more complex views such as the old
 * notation view -- but it's retained more or less verbatim "for
 * historical reasons" awaiting a possible future refactoring.
 *
 * Apart from that, it also provides some widget layout skeleton code,
 * and a few utility methods.
 *
 * Currently the subclasses of this class are EventView and TempoView,
 * which is why it is named ListEditView -- because it's used by list
 * edit views, not because it provides anything particularly focused
 * on lists.
